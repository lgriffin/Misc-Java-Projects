This is a repository for some of the Java based projects that I worked on 
throughout my PhD. The work here is experimental and was an evolution of my
work in the XMPP area.

- The XMPP Client was one of my first working examples where I broke down
the core components of an XMPP system and evolved an architecture
and associated set of Interfaces. The Interface set was used on a number of projects
both personal and professionally to build up a small working IM system external to a 
GUI based client. The GUI client included is merely for testing purposes.

Some Web Services code will be uploaded in the coming weeks.
